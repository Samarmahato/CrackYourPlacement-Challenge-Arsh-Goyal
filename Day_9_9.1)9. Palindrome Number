Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.

An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.
 

Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

    bool isPalindrome(int x) {
        int r=x;
        long long int res=0;
        
        while(x>0 && x!=0){ 
          int x1=x%10; 
           res=res*10+x1;
            x=x/10;
        }
        
       if(r==res){
           return true;
       } 
    return false;   
    }
};
