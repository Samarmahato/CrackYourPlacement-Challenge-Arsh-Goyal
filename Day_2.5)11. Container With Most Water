You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        
        int ans=0;
        int left=0;
        int right=height.size()-1;
        while(left<=right){
           ans=max(min(height[left],height[right])*(right-left),ans);
            if(height[left]<=height[right]){
                left++;
            }else{
                right--;
